# The font families to use.
#
# You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
#
#     ghostty +list-fonts
#
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
# fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary
# font. This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts,
# etc.
#
# Notes on emoji specifically: On macOS, Ghostty by default will always use
# Apple Color Emoji and on Linux will always use Noto Emoji. You can
# override this behavior by specifying a font family here that contains
# emoji glyphs.
#
# The specific styles (bold, italic, bold italic) do not need to be
# explicitly set. If a style is not set, then the regular style (font-family)
# will be searched for stylistic variants. If a stylistic variant is not
# found, Ghostty will use the regular style. This prevents falling back to a
# different font family just to get a style such as bold. This also applies
# if you explicitly specify a font family for a style. For example, if you
# set `font-family-bold = FooBar` and "FooBar" cannot be found, Ghostty will
# use whatever font is set for `font-family` for the bold style.
#
# Finally, some styles may be synthesized if they are not supported.
# For example, if a font does not have an italic style and no alternative
# italic font is specified, Ghostty will synthesize an italic style by
# applying a slant to the regular style. If you want to disable these
# synthesized styles then you can use the `font-style` configurations
# as documented below.
#
# You can disable styles completely by using the `font-style` set of
# configurations. See the documentation for `font-style` for more information.
#
# If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a fallback,
# specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the
# new values. For example:
#
#     font-family = ""
#     font-family = "My Favorite Font"
#
# Setting any of these as CLI arguments will automatically clear the
# values set in configuration files so you don't need to specify
# `--font-family=""` before setting a new value. You only need to specify
# this within config files if you want to clear previously set values in
# configuration files or on the CLI if you want to clear values set on the
# CLI.
font-family = Maple Mono

# Apply a font feature. To enable multiple font features you can repeat
# this multiple times or use a comma-separated list of feature settings.
#
# The syntax for feature settings is as follows, where `feat` is a feature:
#
#   * Enable features with e.g. `feat`, `+feat`, `feat on`, `feat=1`.
#   * Disabled features with e.g. `-feat`, `feat off`, `feat=0`.
#   * Set a feature value with e.g. `feat=2`, `feat = 3`, `feat 4`.
#   * Feature names may be wrapped in quotes, meaning this config should be
#     syntactically compatible with the `font-feature-settings` CSS property.
#
# The syntax is fairly loose, but invalid settings will be silently ignored.
#
# The font feature will apply to all fonts rendered by Ghostty. A future
# enhancement will allow targeting specific faces.
#
# To disable programming ligatures, use `-calt` since this is the typical
# feature name for programming ligatures. To look into what font features
# your font has and what they do, use a font inspection tool such as
# [fontdrop.info](https://fontdrop.info).
#
# To generally disable most ligatures, use `-calt, -liga, -dlig`.

# -- contextual alternatives --
font-feature = calt
# -- character variants --
# zero: 0
font-feature = zero
# cv01: @ # $ % & Q -> =>
font-feature = cv01
# cv03: i
font-feature = cv03
# -- stylistic sets --
# ss03: [trace] [debug] [info] [warn] [error] [fatal] [todo] [fixme]
font-feature = ss03
# ss08: >>= -<< ->> >-
font-feature = ss08

# A repeatable configuration to set one or more font variations values for
# a variable font. A variable font is a single font, usually with a filename
# ending in `-VF.ttf` or `-VF.otf` that contains one or more configurable axes
# for things such as weight, slant, etc. Not all fonts support variations;
# only fonts that explicitly state they are variable fonts will work.
#
# The format of this is `id=value` where `id` is the axis identifier. An axis
# identifier is always a 4 character string, such as `wght`. To get the list
# of supported axes, look at your font documentation or use a font inspection
# tool.
#
# Invalid ids and values are usually ignored. For example, if a font only
# supports weights from 100 to 700, setting `wght=800` will do nothing (it
# will not be clamped to 700). You must consult your font's documentation to
# see what values are supported.
#
# Common axes are: `wght` (weight), `slnt` (slant), `ital` (italic), `opsz`
# (optical size), `wdth` (width), `GRAD` (gradient), etc.
font-variation = wght=500

# Locations to break font shaping into multiple runs.
#
# A "run" is a contiguous segment of text that is shaped together. "Shaping"
# is the process of converting text (codepoints) into glyphs (renderable
# characters). This is how ligatures are formed, among other things.
# For example, if a coding font turns "!=" into a single glyph, then it
# must see "!" and "=" next to each other in a single run. When a run
# is broken, the text is shaped separately. To continue our example, if
# "!" is at the end of one run and "=" is at the start of the next run,
# then the ligature will not be formed.
#
# Ghostty breaks runs at certain points to improve readability or usability.
# For example, Ghostty by default will break runs under the cursor so that
# text editing can see the individual characters rather than a ligature.
# This configuration lets you configure this behavior.
#
# Combine values with a comma to set multiple options. Prefix an
# option with "no-" to disable it. Enabling and disabling options
# can be done at the same time.
#
# Available options:
#
#   * `cursor` - Break runs under the cursor.
#
# Available since: 1.2.0
font-shaping-break = cursor

# A theme to use. This can be a built-in theme name, a custom theme
# name, or an absolute path to a custom theme file. Ghostty also supports
# specifying a different theme to use for light and dark mode. Each
# option is documented below.
#
# If the theme is an absolute pathname, Ghostty will attempt to load that
# file as a theme. If that file does not exist or is inaccessible, an error
# will be logged and no other directories will be searched.
#
# If the theme is not an absolute pathname, two different directories will be
# searched for a file name that matches the theme. This is case sensitive on
# systems with case-sensitive filesystems. It is an error for a theme name to
# include path separators unless it is an absolute pathname.
#
# The first directory is the `themes` subdirectory of your Ghostty
# configuration directory. This is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ghostty/themes` or
# `~/.config/ghostty/themes`.
#
# The second directory is the `themes` subdirectory of the Ghostty resources
# directory. Ghostty ships with a multitude of themes that will be installed
# into this directory. On macOS, this list is in the
# `Ghostty.app/Contents/Resources/ghostty/themes` directory. On Linux, this
# list is in the `share/ghostty/themes` directory (wherever you installed the
# Ghostty "share" directory.
#
# To see a list of available themes, run `ghostty +list-themes`.
#
# A theme file is simply another Ghostty configuration file. They share
# the same syntax and same configuration options. A theme can set any valid
# configuration option so please do not use a theme file from an untrusted
# source. The built-in themes are audited to only set safe configuration
# options.
#
# Some options cannot be set within theme files. The reason these are not
# supported should be self-evident. A theme file cannot set `theme` or
# `config-file`. At the time of writing this, Ghostty will not show any
# warnings or errors if you set these options in a theme file but they will
# be silently ignored.
#
# Any additional colors specified via background, foreground, palette, etc.
# will override the colors specified in the theme.
#
# To specify a different theme for light and dark mode, use the following
# syntax: `light:theme-name,dark:theme-name`. For example:
# `light:Rose Pine Dawn,dark:Rose Pine`. Whitespace around all values are
# trimmed and order of light and dark does not matter. Both light and dark
# must be specified in this form. In this form, the theme used will be
# based on the current desktop environment theme.
#
# There are some known bugs with light/dark mode theming. These will
# be fixed in a future update:
#
#   - macOS: titlebar tabs style is not updated when switching themes.

# Whether to clear selected text after copying. This defaults to `false`.
#
# When set to `true`, the selection will be automatically cleared after
# any copy operation that invokes the `copy_to_clipboard` keyboard binding.
# Importantly, this will not clear the selection if the copy operation
# was invoked via `copy-on-select`.
#
# When set to `false`, the selection remains visible after copying, allowing
# to see what was copied and potentially perform additional operations
# on the same selection.
selection-clear-on-copy = false

# The minimum contrast ratio between the foreground and background colors.
# The contrast ratio is a value between 1 and 21. A value of 1 allows for no
# contrast (e.g. black on black). This value is the contrast ratio as defined
# by the [WCAG 2.0 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).
#
# If you want to avoid invisible text (same color as background), a value of
# 1.1 is a good value. If you want to avoid text that is difficult to read, a
# value of 3 or higher is a good value. The higher the value, the more likely
# that text will become black or white.
#
# This value does not apply to Emoji or images.
minimum-contrast = 1

# The style of the cursor. This sets the default style. A running program can
# still request an explicit cursor style using escape sequences (such as `CSI
# q`). Shell configurations will often request specific cursor styles.
#
# Note that shell integration will automatically set the cursor to a bar at
# a prompt, regardless of this configuration. You can disable that behavior
# by specifying `shell-integration-features = no-cursor` or disabling shell
# integration entirely.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#   * `block`
#   * `bar`
#   * `underline`
#   * `block_hollow`
cursor-style = block

# Enables the ability to move the cursor at prompts by using `alt+click` on
# Linux and `option+click` on macOS.
#
# This feature requires shell integration (specifically prompt marking
# via `OSC 133`) and only works in primary screen mode. Alternate screen
# applications like vim usually have their own version of this feature but
# this configuration doesn't control that.
#
# It should be noted that this feature works by translating your desired
# position into a series of synthetic arrow key movements, so some weird
# behavior around edge cases are to be expected. This is unfortunately how
# this feature is implemented across terminals because there isn't any other
# way to implement it.
cursor-click-to-move = true

# Hide the mouse immediately when typing. The mouse becomes visible again
# when the mouse is used (button, movement, etc.). Platform-specific behavior

# When to scroll the surface to the bottom. The format of this is a list of
# options to enable separated by commas. If you prefix an option with `no-`
# then it is disabled. If you omit an option, its default value is used.
#
# Available options:
#
# - `keystroke` If set, scroll the surface to the bottom when the user
#   presses a key that results in data being sent to the PTY (basically
#   anything but modifiers or keybinds that are processed by Ghostty).
#
# - `output` If set, scroll the surface to the bottom if there is new data
#   to display. (Currently unimplemented.)
#
# The default is `keystroke, no-output`.
scroll-to-bottom = keystroke,no-output

# Determines whether running programs can detect the shift key pressed with a
# mouse click. Typically, the shift key is used to extend mouse selection.
#
# The default value of `false` means that the shift key is not sent with
# the mouse protocol and will extend the selection. This value can be
# conditionally overridden by the running program with the `XTSHIFTESCAPE`
# sequence.
#
# The value `true` means that the shift key is sent with the mouse protocol
# but the running program can override this behavior with `XTSHIFTESCAPE`.
#
# The value `never` is the same as `false` but the running program cannot
# override this behavior with `XTSHIFTESCAPE`. The value `always` is the
# same as `true` but the running program cannot override this behavior with
# `XTSHIFTESCAPE`.
#
# If you always want shift to extend mouse selection even if the program
# requests otherwise, set this to `never`.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#   * `true`
#   * `false`
#   * `always`
#   * `never`
mouse-shift-capture = false

# Multiplier for scrolling distance with the mouse wheel.
#
# A prefix of `precision:` or `discrete:` can be used to set the multiplier
# only for scrolling with the specific type of devices. These can be
# comma-separated to set both types of multipliers at the same time, e.g.
# `precision:0.1,discrete:3`. If no prefix is used, the multiplier applies
# to all scrolling devices. Specifying a prefix was introduced in Ghostty
# 1.2.1.
#
# The value will be clamped to [0.01, 10,000]. Both of these are extreme
# and you're likely to have a bad experience if you set either extreme.
#
# The default value is "3" for discrete devices and "1" for precision devices.
mouse-scroll-multiplier = precision:1,discrete:3

# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of the background. A value of
# 1 is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. A value less than 0
# or greater than 1 will be clamped to the nearest valid value.
#
# On macOS, background opacity is disabled when the terminal enters native
# fullscreen. This is because the background becomes gray and it can cause
# widgets to show through which isn't generally desirable.
#
# On macOS, changing this configuration requires restarting Ghostty completely.
background-opacity = 0.85

# Applies background opacity to cells with an explicit background color
# set.
#
# Normally, `background-opacity` is only applied to the window background.
# If a cell has an explicit background color set, such as red, then that
# background color will be fully opaque. An effect of this is that some
# terminal applications that repaint the background color of the terminal
# such as a Neovim and Tmux may not respect the `background-opacity`
# (by design).
#
# Setting this to `true` will apply the `background-opacity` to all cells
# regardless of whether they have an explicit background color set or not.
#
# Available since: 1.2.0
background-opacity-cells = true

# Whether to blur the background when `background-opacity` is less than 1.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#   * a nonnegative integer specifying the *blur intensity*
#   * `false`, equivalent to a blur intensity of 0
#   * `true`, equivalent to the default blur intensity of 20, which is
#     reasonable for a good looking blur. Higher blur intensities may
#     cause strange rendering and performance issues.
#
# Supported on macOS and on some Linux desktop environments, including:
#
#   * KDE Plasma (Wayland and X11)
#
# Warning: the exact blur intensity is _ignored_ under KDE Plasma, and setting
# this setting to either `true` or any positive blur intensity value would
# achieve the same effect. The reason is that KWin, the window compositor
# powering Plasma, only has one global blur setting and does not allow
# applications to specify individual blur settings.
#
# To configure KWin's global blur setting, open System Settings and go to
# "Apps & Windows" > "Window Management" > "Desktop Effects" and select the
# "Blur" plugin. If disabled, enable it by ticking the checkbox to the left.
# Then click on the "Configure" button and there will be two sliders that
# allow you to set background blur and noise intensities for all apps,
# including Ghostty.
#
# All other Linux desktop environments are as of now unsupported. Users may
# need to set environment-specific settings and/or install third-party plugins
# in order to support background blur, as there isn't a unified interface for
# doing so.
background-blur = true

# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of an unfocused split.
# Unfocused splits by default are slightly faded out to make it easier to see
# which split is focused. To disable this feature, set this value to 1.
#
# A value of 1 is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. Because
# "0" is not useful (it makes the window look very weird), the minimum value
# is 0.15. This value still looks weird but you can at least see what's going
# on. A value outside of the range 0.15 to 1 will be clamped to the nearest
# valid value.
unfocused-split-opacity = 0.7

# If true, keep the terminal open after the command exits. Normally, the
# terminal window closes when the running command (such as a shell) exits.
# With this true, the terminal window will stay open until any keypress is
# received.
#
# This is primarily useful for scripts or debugging.
wait-after-command = false

# The size of the scrollback buffer in bytes. This also includes the active
# screen. No matter what this is set to, enough memory will always be
# allocated for the visible screen and anything leftover is the limit for
# the scrollback.
#
# When this limit is reached, the oldest lines are removed from the
# scrollback.
#
# Scrollback currently exists completely in memory. This means that the
# larger this value, the larger potential memory usage. Scrollback is
# allocated lazily up to this limit, so if you set this to a very large
# value, it will not immediately consume a lot of memory.
#
# This size is per terminal surface, not for the entire application.
#
# It is not currently possible to set an unlimited scrollback buffer.
# This is a future planned feature.
#
# This can be changed at runtime but will only affect new terminal surfaces.
scrollback-limit = 10000000

# Key bindings. The format is `trigger=action`. Duplicate triggers will
# overwrite previously set values. The list of actions is available in
# the documentation or using the `ghostty +list-actions` command.
#
# Trigger: `+`-separated list of keys and modifiers. Example: `ctrl+a`,
# `ctrl+shift+b`, `up`.
#
# If the key is a single Unicode codepoint, the trigger will match
# any presses that produce that codepoint. These are impacted by
# keyboard layouts. For example, `a` will match the `a` key on a
# QWERTY keyboard, but will match the `q` key on a AZERTY keyboard
# (assuming US physical layout).
#
# For Unicode codepoints, matching is done by comparing the set of
# modifiers with the unmodified codepoint. The unmodified codepoint is
# sometimes called an "unshifted character" in other software, but all
# modifiers are considered, not only shift. For example, `ctrl+a` will match
# `a` but not `ctrl+shift+a` (which is `A` on a US keyboard).
#
# Further, codepoint matching is case-insensitive and the unmodified
# codepoint is always case folded for comparison. As a result,
# `ctrl+A` configured will match when `ctrl+a` is pressed. Note that
# this means some key combinations are impossible depending on keyboard
# layout. For example, `ctrl+_` is impossible on a US keyboard because
# `_` is `shift+-` and `ctrl+shift+-` is not equal to `ctrl+_` (because
# the modifiers don't match!). More details on impossible key combinations
# can be found at this excellent source written by Qt developers:
# https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qkeysequence.html#keyboard-layout-issues
#
# Physical key codes can be specified by using any of the key codes
# as specified by the [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/).
# For example, `KeyA` will match the physical `a` key on a US standard
# keyboard regardless of the keyboard layout. These are case-sensitive.
#
# For aesthetic reasons, the w3c codes also support snake case. For
# example, `key_a` is equivalent to `KeyA`. The only exceptions are
# function keys, e.g. `F1` is `f1` (no underscore). This is a consequence
# of our internal code using snake case but is purposely supported
# and tested so it is safe to use. It allows an all-lowercase binding
# which I find more aesthetically pleasing.
#
# Function keys such as `insert`, `up`, `f5`, etc. are also specified
# using the keys as specified by the previously linked W3C specification.
#
# Physical keys always match with a higher priority than Unicode codepoints,
# so if you specify both `a` and `KeyA`, the physical key will always be used
# regardless of what order they are configured.
#
# Valid modifiers are `shift`, `ctrl` (alias: `control`), `alt` (alias: `opt`,
# `option`), and `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`). You may use the modifier
# or the alias. When debugging keybinds, the non-aliased modifier will always
# be used in output.
#
# Note: The fn or "globe" key on keyboards are not supported as a
# modifier. This is a limitation of the operating systems and GUI toolkits
# that Ghostty uses.
#
# Some additional notes for triggers:
#
#   * modifiers cannot repeat, `ctrl+ctrl+a` is invalid.
#
#   * modifiers and keys can be in any order, `shift+a+ctrl` is *weird*,
#     but valid.
#
#   * only a single key input is allowed, `ctrl+a+b` is invalid.
#
# You may also specify multiple triggers separated by `>` to require a
# sequence of triggers to activate the action. For example,
# `ctrl+a>n=new_window` will only trigger the `new_window` action if the
# user presses `ctrl+a` followed separately by `n`. In other software, this
# is sometimes called a leader key, a key chord, a key table, etc. There
# is no hardcoded limit on the number of parts in a sequence.
#
# Warning: If you define a sequence as a CLI argument to `ghostty`,
# you probably have to quote the keybind since `>` is a special character
# in most shells. Example: ghostty --keybind='ctrl+a>n=new_window'
#
# A trigger sequence has some special handling:
#
#   * Ghostty will wait an indefinite amount of time for the next key in
#     the sequence. There is no way to specify a timeout. The only way to
#     force the output of a prefix key is to assign another keybind to
#     specifically output that key (e.g. `ctrl+a>ctrl+a=text:foo`) or
#     press an unbound key which will send both keys to the program.
#
#   * If a prefix in a sequence is previously bound, the sequence will
#     override the previous binding. For example, if `ctrl+a` is bound to
#     `new_window` and `ctrl+a>n` is bound to `new_tab`, pressing `ctrl+a`
#     will do nothing.
#
#   * Adding to the above, if a previously bound sequence prefix is
#     used in a new, non-sequence binding, the entire previously bound
#     sequence will be unbound. For example, if you bind `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t`, and then bind `ctrl+a` directly, both `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t` will become unbound.
#
#   * Trigger sequences are not allowed for `global:` or `all:`-prefixed
#     triggers. This is a limitation we could remove in the future.
#
# Action is the action to take when the trigger is satisfied. It takes the
# format `action` or `action:param`. The latter form is only valid if the
# action requires a parameter.
#
#   * `ignore` - Do nothing, ignore the key input. This can be used to
#     black hole certain inputs to have no effect.
#
#   * `unbind` - Remove the binding. This makes it so the previous action
#     is removed, and the key will be sent through to the child command
#     if it is printable. Unbind will remove any matching trigger,
#     including `physical:`-prefixed triggers without specifying the
#     prefix.
#
#   * `csi:text` - Send a CSI sequence. e.g. `csi:A` sends "cursor up".
#
#   * `esc:text` - Send an escape sequence. e.g. `esc:d` deletes to the
#     end of the word to the right.
#
#   * `text:text` - Send a string. Uses Zig string literal syntax.
#     e.g. `text:\x15` sends Ctrl-U.
#
#   * All other actions can be found in the documentation or by using the
#     `ghostty +list-actions` command.
#
# Some notes for the action:
#
#   * The parameter is taken as-is after the `:`. Double quotes or
#     other mechanisms are included and NOT parsed. If you want to
#     send a string value that includes spaces, wrap the entire
#     trigger/action in double quotes. Example: `--keybind="up=csi:A B"`
#
# There are some additional special values that can be specified for
# keybind:
#
#   * `keybind=clear` will clear all set keybindings. Warning: this
#     removes ALL keybindings up to this point, including the default
#     keybindings.
#
# The keybind trigger can be prefixed with some special values to change
# the behavior of the keybind. These are:
#
#  * `all:`
#
#    Make the keybind apply to all terminal surfaces. By default,
#    keybinds only apply to the focused terminal surface. If this is true,
#    then the keybind will be sent to all terminal surfaces. This only
#    applies to actions that are surface-specific. For actions that
#    are already global (e.g. `quit`), this prefix has no effect.
#
#    Available since: 1.0.0
#
#  * `global:`
#
#    Make the keybind global. By default, keybinds only work within Ghostty
#    and under the right conditions (application focused, sometimes terminal
#    focused, etc.). If you want a keybind to work globally across your system
#    (e.g. even when Ghostty is not focused), specify this prefix.
#    This prefix implies `all:`.
#
#    Note: this does not work in all environments; see the additional notes
#    below for more information.
#
#    Available since: 1.0.0 on macOS, 1.2.0 on GTK
#
#  * `unconsumed:`
#
#    Do not consume the input. By default, a keybind will consume the input,
#    meaning that the associated encoding (if any) will not be sent to the
#    running program in the terminal. If you wish to send the encoded value
#    to the program, specify the `unconsumed:` prefix before the entire
#    keybind. For example: `unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config`. `global:` and
#    `all:`-prefixed keybinds will always consume the input regardless of
#    this setting. Since they are not associated with a specific terminal
#    surface, they're never encoded.
#
#    Available since: 1.0.0
#
#  * `performable:`
#
#    Only consume the input if the action is able to be performed.
#    For example, the `copy_to_clipboard` action will only consume the input
#    if there is a selection to copy. If there is no selection, Ghostty
#    behaves as if the keybind was not set. This has no effect with `global:`
#    or `all:`-prefixed keybinds. For key sequences, this will reset the
#    sequence if the action is not performable (acting identically to not
#    having a keybind set at all).
#
#    Performable keybinds will not appear as menu shortcuts in the
#    application menu. This is because the menu shortcuts force the
#    action to be performed regardless of the state of the terminal.
#    Performable keybinds will still work, they just won't appear as
#    a shortcut label in the menu.
#
#    Available since: 1.1.0
#
# Keybind triggers are not unique per prefix combination. For example,
# `ctrl+a` and `global:ctrl+a` are not two separate keybinds. The keybind
# set later will overwrite the keybind set earlier. In this case, the
# `global:` keybind will be used.
#
# Multiple prefixes can be specified. For example,
# `global:unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config` will make the keybind global
# and not consume the input to reload the config.
#
# Note: `global:` is only supported on macOS and certain Linux platforms.
#
# On macOS, this feature requires accessibility permissions to be granted
# to Ghostty. When a `global:` keybind is specified and Ghostty is launched
# or reloaded, Ghostty will attempt to request these permissions.
# If the permissions are not granted, the keybind will not work. On macOS,
# you can find these permissions in System Preferences -> Privacy & Security
# -> Accessibility.
#
# On Linux, you need a desktop environment that implements the
# [Global Shortcuts](https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/doc-org.freedesktop.portal.GlobalShortcuts.html)
# protocol as a part of its XDG desktop protocol implementation.
# Desktop environments that are known to support (or not support)
# global shortcuts include:
#
#  - Users using KDE Plasma (since [5.27](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.27.0/#wayland))
#    and GNOME (since [48](https://release.gnome.org/48/#and-thats-not-all)) should be able
#    to use global shortcuts with little to no configuration.
#
#  - Some manual configuration is required on Hyprland. Consult the steps
#    outlined on the [Hyprland Wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Binds/#dbus-global-shortcuts)
#    to set up global shortcuts correctly.
#    (Important: [`xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland`](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland/)
#    must also be installed!)
#
#  - Notably, global shortcuts have not been implemented on wlroots-based
#    compositors like Sway (see [upstream issue](https://github.com/emersion/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr/issues/240)).

#
# Valid values:
#
#  * `none`
#
#    All window decorations will be disabled. Titlebar, borders, etc. will

# integration, such as preserving working directories. See `shell-integration`
# for more information.
#
# There are three valid values for this configuration:
#
#   * `default` will use the default system behavior. On macOS, this
#     will only save state if the application is forcibly terminated
#     or if it is configured systemwide via Settings.app.
#
#   * `never` will never save window state.
#
#   * `always` will always save window state whenever Ghostty is exited.
#
# If you change this value to `never` while Ghostty is not running, the next
# Ghostty launch will NOT restore the window state.
#
# If you change this value to `default` while Ghostty is not running and the
# previous exit saved state, the next Ghostty launch will still restore the
# window state. This is because Ghostty cannot know if the previous exit was
# due to a forced save or not (macOS doesn't provide this information).
#
# If you change this value so that window state is saved while Ghostty is not
# running, the previous window state will not be restored because Ghostty only
# saves state on exit if this is enabled.

# Whether to enable shell integration auto-injection or not. Shell integration
# greatly enhances the terminal experience by enabling a number of features:

# want. You can also use `true` or `false` to turn all features on or off.
#
# Example: `cursor`, `no-cursor`, `sudo`, `no-sudo`, `title`, `no-title`
#
# Available features:
#
#   * `cursor` - Set the cursor to a blinking bar at the prompt.
#
#   * `sudo` - Set sudo wrapper to preserve terminfo.
#
#   * `title` - Set the window title via shell integration.
#
#   * `ssh-env` - Enable SSH environment variable compatibility. Automatically
#     converts TERM from `xterm-ghostty` to `xterm-256color` when connecting to
#     remote hosts and propagates COLORTERM, TERM_PROGRAM, and TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION.
#     Whether or not these variables will be accepted by the remote host(s) will
#     depend on whether or not the variables are allowed in their sshd_config.
#     (Available since: 1.2.0)
#
#   * `ssh-terminfo` - Enable automatic terminfo installation on remote hosts.
#     Attempts to install Ghostty's terminfo entry using `infocmp` and `tic` when
#     connecting to hosts that lack it. Requires `infocmp` to be available locally
#     and `tic` to be available on remote hosts. Once terminfo is installed on a
#     remote host, it will be automatically "cached" to avoid repeat installations.
#     If desired, the `+ssh-cache` CLI action can be used to manage the installation
#     cache manually using various arguments.
#     (Available since: 1.2.0)
#
#   * `path` - Add Ghostty's binary directory to PATH. This ensures the `ghostty`
#     command is available in the shell even if shell init scripts reset PATH.
#     This is particularly useful on macOS where PATH is often overridden by
#     system scripts. The directory is only added if not already present.
#
# SSH features work independently and can be combined for optimal experience:
# when both `ssh-env` and `ssh-terminfo` are enabled, Ghostty will install its
# terminfo on remote hosts and use `xterm-ghostty` as TERM, falling back to
# `xterm-256color` with environment variables if terminfo installation fails.

# Custom entries into the command palette.
#
# Each entry requires the title, the corresponding action, and an optional

# to the one for keybind actions. Whitespace in between fields is ignored.
#
# If you need to embed commas or any other special characters in the values,
# enclose the value in double quotes and it will be interpreted as a Zig
# string literal. This is also useful for including whitespace at the
# beginning or the end of a value. See the
# [Zig documentation](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Escape-Sequences)
# for more information on string literals. Note that multiline string literals
# are not supported.

# Custom shaders to run after the default shaders. This is a file path
# to a GLSL-syntax shader for all platforms.
#
# Warning: Invalid shaders can cause Ghostty to become unusable such as by
# causing the window to be completely black. If this happens, you can
# unset this configuration to disable the shader.
#
# Custom shader support is based on and compatible with the Shadertoy shaders.
# Shaders should specify a `mainImage` function and the available uniforms
# largely match Shadertoy, with some caveats and Ghostty-specific extensions.
#
# The uniform values available to shaders are as follows:
#
#  * `sampler2D iChannel0` - Input texture.
#
#    A texture containing the current terminal screen. If multiple custom
#    shaders are specified, the output of previous shaders is written to
#    this texture, to allow combining multiple effects.
#
#  * `vec3 iResolution` - Output texture size, `[width, height, 1]` (in px).
#
#  * `float iTime` - Time in seconds since first frame was rendered.
#
#  * `float iTimeDelta` - Time in seconds since previous frame was rendered.
#
#  * `float iFrameRate` - Average framerate. (NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED)
#
#  * `int iFrame` - Number of frames that have been rendered so far.
#
#  * `float iChannelTime[4]` - Current time for video or sound input. (N/A)
#
#  * `vec3 iChannelResolution[4]` - Resolutions of the 4 input samplers.
#
#    Currently only `iChannel0` exists, and `iChannelResolution[0]` is
#    identical to `iResolution`.
#
#  * `vec4 iMouse` - Mouse input info. (NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED)
#
#  * `vec4 iDate` - Date/time info. (NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED)
#
#  * `float iSampleRate` - Sample rate for audio. (N/A)
#
# Ghostty-specific extensions:
#
#  * `vec4 iCurrentCursor` - Info about the terminal cursor.
#
#    - `iCurrentCursor.xy` is the -X, +Y corner of the current cursor.
#    - `iCurrentCursor.zw` is the width and height of the current cursor.
#
#  * `vec4 iPreviousCursor` - Info about the previous terminal cursor.
#
#  * `vec4 iCurrentCursorColor` - Color of the terminal cursor.
#
#  * `vec4 iPreviousCursorColor` - Color of the previous terminal cursor.
#
#  * `float iTimeCursorChange` - Timestamp of terminal cursor change.
#
#    When the terminal cursor changes position or color, this is set to
#    the same time as the `iTime` uniform, allowing you to compute the
#    time since the change by subtracting this from `iTime`.
#
# If the shader fails to compile, the shader will be ignored. Any errors
# related to shader compilation will not show up as configuration errors
# and only show up in the log, since shader compilation happens after
# configuration loading on the dedicated render thread.  For interactive
# development, use [shadertoy.com](https://shadertoy.com).

#
# If this is set to `false`, the terminal and custom shader will only render

# not animate.
#
# This can also be set to `always`, which will always run the animation

# then it is disabled. If you omit a feature, its default value is used.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#  * `system`
#
#    Instruct the system to notify the user using built-in system functions.
#    This could result in an audiovisual effect, a notification, or something
#    else entirely. Changing these effects require altering system settings:
#    for instance under the "Sound > Alert Sound" setting in GNOME,
#    or the "Accessibility > System Bell" settings in KDE Plasma. (GTK only)
#
#  * `audio`
#
#    Play a custom sound. (GTK only)
#
#  * `attention` *(enabled by default)*
#
#    Request the user's attention when Ghostty is unfocused, until it has
#    received focus again. On macOS, this will bounce the app icon in the
#    dock once. On Linux, the behavior depends on the desktop environment
#    and/or the window manager/compositor:
#
#    - On KDE, the background of the desktop icon in the task bar would be
#      highlighted;
#
#    - On GNOME, you may receive a notification that, when clicked, would
#      bring the Ghostty window into focus;
#
#    - On Sway, the window may be decorated with a distinctly colored border;
#
#    - On other systems this may have no effect at all.
#
#  * `title` *(enabled by default)*
#
#    Prepend a bell emoji (🔔) to the title of the alerted surface until the
#    terminal is re-focused or interacted with (such as on keyboard input).
#
#  * `border`
#
#    Display a border around the alerted surface until the terminal is
#    re-focused or interacted with (such as on keyboard input).

#
# To specify a notification to enable, specify the name of the notification.
# To specify a notification to disable, prefix the name with `no-`. For
# example, to disable `clipboard-copy`, set this configuration to
# `no-clipboard-copy`. To enable it, set this configuration to `clipboard-copy`.
#
# Multiple notifications can be enabled or disabled by separating them
# with a comma.

# The style of the macOS titlebar. Available values are: "native",
# "transparent", "tabs", and "hidden".
#
# The "native" style uses the native macOS titlebar with zero customization.
# The titlebar will match your window theme (see `window-theme`).
#
# The "transparent" style is the same as "native" but the titlebar will
# be transparent and allow your window background color to come through.
# This makes a more seamless window appearance but looks a little less
# typical for a macOS application and may not work well with all themes.
#
# The "transparent" style will also update in real-time to dynamic
# changes to the window background color, e.g. via OSC 11. To make this
# more aesthetically pleasing, this only happens if the terminal is
# a window, tab, or split that borders the top of the window. This
# avoids a disjointed appearance where the titlebar color changes
# but all the topmost terminals don't match.
#
# The "tabs" style is a completely custom titlebar that integrates the
# tab bar into the titlebar. This titlebar always matches the background
# color of the terminal. There are some limitations to this style:
# On macOS 13 and below, saved window state will not restore tabs correctly.
# macOS 14 does not have this issue and any other macOS version has not
# been tested.
#
# The "hidden" style hides the titlebar. Unlike `window-decoration = false`,
# however, it does not remove the frame from the window or cause it to have
# squared corners. Changing to or from this option at run-time may affect
# existing windows in buggy ways.
#
# When "hidden", the top titlebar area can no longer be used for dragging
# the window. To drag the window, you can use option+click on the resizable
# areas of the frame to drag the window. This is a standard macOS behavior
# and not something Ghostty enables.
#
# The default value is "transparent". This is an opinionated choice
# but its one I think is the most aesthetically pleasing and works in
# most cases.

#
# This setting can be changed at runtime and will affect all currently

# macOS doesn't have a distinct "alt" key and instead has the "option"
# key which behaves slightly differently. On macOS by default, the

# For example, on US standard layouts option-b produces "∫". This may be
# undesirable if you want to use "option" as an "alt" key for keybindings
# in terminal programs or shells.
#
# This configuration lets you change the behavior so that option is treated
# as alt.
#
# The default behavior (unset) will depend on your active keyboard
# layout. If your keyboard layout is one of the keyboard layouts listed
# below, then the default value is "true". Otherwise, the default
# value is "false". Keyboard layouts with a default value of "true" are:
#
#   - U.S. Standard
#   - U.S. International
#
# Note that if an *Option*-sequence doesn't produce a printable character, it
# will be treated as *Alt* regardless of this setting. (e.g. `alt+ctrl+a`).
#
# Explicit values that can be set:
#
# If `true`, the *Option* key will be treated as *Alt*. This makes terminal
# sequences expecting *Alt* to work properly, but will break Unicode input
# sequences on macOS if you use them via the *Alt* key.
#
# You may set this to `false` to restore the macOS *Alt* key unicode
# sequences but this will break terminal sequences expecting *Alt* to work.
#
# The values `left` or `right` enable this for the left or right *Option*
# key, respectively.

# specific color is set, this color will always be used for the default
# bold text color. It will set the rest of the bold colors to `bright`.
#
# This can also be set to `bright`, which uses the bright color palette
# for bold text. For example, if the text is red, then the bold will
# use the bright red color. The terminal palette is set with `palette`
# but can also be overridden by the terminal application itself using
# escape sequences such as OSC 4. (Since Ghostty 1.2.0, the previous
# configuration `bold-is-bright` is deprecated and replaced by this
# usage).
#
# Available since Ghostty 1.2.0.
bold-color =

# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of the faint text. A value of
# 1 is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. A value less than 0

# This will be used to set the `TERM` environment variable.
# HACK: We set this with an `xterm` prefix because vim uses that to enable key
# protocols (specifically this will enable `modifyOtherKeys`), among other
# features. An option exists in vim to modify this: `:set
# keyprotocol=ghostty:kitty`, however a bug in the implementation prevents it
# from working properly. https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/13211 fixes this.

# Control the auto-update functionality of Ghostty. This is only supported
# on macOS currently, since Linux builds are distributed via package
# managers that are not centrally controlled by Ghostty.
#
# Checking or downloading an update does not send any information to
# the project beyond standard network information mandated by the
# underlying protocols. To put it another way: Ghostty doesn't explicitly
# add any tracking to the update process. The update process works by
# downloading information about the latest version and comparing it
# client-side to the current version.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#  * `off` - Disable auto-updates.
#  * `check` - Check for updates and notify the user if an update is
#    available, but do not automatically download or install the update.
#  * `download` - Check for updates, automatically download the update,
#    notify the user, but do not automatically install the update.
#
# If unset, we defer to Sparkle's default behavior, which respects the
# preference stored in the standard user defaults (`defaults(1)`).
#
# Changing this value at runtime works after a small delay.
auto-update = check

# The release channel to use for auto-updates.
#
# The default value of this matches the release channel of the currently
# running Ghostty version. If you download a pre-release version of Ghostty
# then this will be set to `tip` and you will receive pre-release updates.
# If you download a stable version of Ghostty then this will be set to
# `stable` and you will receive stable updates.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#  * `stable` - Stable, tagged releases such as "1.0.0".
#  * `tip` - Pre-release versions generated from each commit to the
#    main branch. This is the version that was in use during private
#    beta testing by thousands of people. It is generally stable but
#    will likely have more bugs than the stable channel.
#
# Changing this configuration requires a full restart of
# Ghostty to take effect.
#
# This only works on macOS since only macOS has an auto-update feature.
